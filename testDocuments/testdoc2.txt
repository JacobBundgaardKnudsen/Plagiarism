Polar stratospheric clouds are clouds that occur in the lower stratosphere at very low temperatures. Polar stratospheric clouds have a great impact on radiative forcing. Due to their minimal albedo properties and their thickness, polar stratospheric clouds act similar to a  and traps outgoing longwave radiation.
Pivoted at the front of the vehicle is a dozer blade that can be used in a V-configuration or as a straight dozer blade. When not required it is raised clear of the ground. On the vehicle's rear, a mine-clearing system is mounted.IMR-2M1 - Simplified model without the mine-clearing system. Entered service in 1987.IMR-2M2 - Improved version that is better suited for operations in dangerous situations, for example in contaminated areas. NHRA and IHRA share some of these classes, but many are solely used by one sanctioning body or the other.
